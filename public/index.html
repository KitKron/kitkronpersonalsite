<p>Cars rushed by. The sun glared down at me, mocking me. I think it knew how much it irritated me, at least that’s what it felt like. I was under a tiny bridge that supported a small section of the I-5 in central California, just outside of Redding. I had been hitchhiking my way to San Diego to see a few friends. That was no longer my goal. The grasshoppers and crickets made long, droning chirps around me. I had never been this uncomfortable. It made me want to claw at my skin. Yet I couldn’t move, and I hadn’t been able to move for some time, ever since that car came out of nowhere and shoved me down into this miserable hole. The sun was burning itself into my vision. I wished more than anything that I could shut my eyes, but they wouldn’t budge. It made it worse that I could feel everything. I could feel my leg bending backwards under me, the bone poking out like a jagged knife. I could feel my shattered spine and how my ribs punctured my lungs. My intestines hung out of my abdomen. My brain was exposed to the elements. I couldn’t stop thinking about how frightening a sight I must be.</p>
<p>I had died a few hours ago. Surprisingly, death was less painful than what I was experiencing now. It felt like an odd mixture of being high and extremely tired at the same time, the pain being barely noticeable. Now, I felt everything. No buffer of fading consciousness, no adrenaline to offset the pain, just raw, unfiltered agony. I wondered if someone would find me soon. I wondered if the creatures of the desert would slowly tear me apart and disperse me throughout the land. I wondered if I would feel it all. The sun was unbearable. I tried to scream, but my jaw was broken and unresponsive. I felt nothing but anger. “What a stupid way to go out,” I thought to myself. Flies started to land on my spilled intestines. I wondered what the point of this was. It felt like divine punishment of some sort. For some reason, I hoped that it was, maybe that would mean it meant something. I thought about how I died, how pointless it felt. I hoped that whatever was happening to me now would balance out how senseless my death was. The desert bugs started to crawl on my skin. The sound of the cars rushing by made me even angrier. Not only was I probably killed by some drunk who was operating one, I also had to listen to people ignoring me, ignoring my suffering. I prayed that someone would find me. I didn’t know who I was praying to.</p>
<p>The sun finally set. It didn’t bring much relief. I was still in a ditch outside Redding under the I-5, listening to cars drive by while bugs wriggled under my skin and birds picked at my flesh and flies swarmed around me. But at least the sun wasn’t in my eyes anymore. I had a lot of time to think. The pain had started to fade into the background, like some undercurrent of suffering. I thought about what led me here. About why I didn’t have a car and had to hitchhike. About whether it was worth dying to see my friends down in San Diego. It wasn’t like I was planning on dying, though. I thought about how I had taken so many unnecessary risks, risks that led up to this moment. I hadn’t really cared about dying before; it felt like an afterthought to any dangerous action. I got angry thinking about that. If only I had known. I came to the realization that this probably wasn’t punishment sent to me by a god or gods or whatever may be out there. There was no purpose in this, just like how there was no purpose in the way that I had died. Things happen when they happen. There was no plan for my future and there was no plan for my death and there was no plan for anything afterward. I felt hopeless. I felt angry again. I hoped this wasn’t how things would be forever, but every second was proving otherwise. I tried to focus on the pain. Hopefully it will stop me from thinking.</p>
<p>It had been a week. My body was bloated and filled with pus and rotten blood and gas. It was so painful. The flies had laid maggots in my open abdomen and my eyes and my mouth. I could feel each tiny little thing wriggling inside me, burrowing and chewing and secreting and living. I was happy at their presents; it made the pain easier to focus on. In the brief moments where the pain would fade to the back of my mind, I would start thinking again. It was worse than any hell I had heard of. All my regrets and mistakes flooded into my brain. All my worry and stress and anger came out. I would try to take deep breaths, but my lungs were filled with bugs, and my throat had collapsed. Eventually the pain would spike, and it would be my focus once again. I had accepted it would be like this forever.</p>
<p>It had been a month. Most of my flesh had been eaten or decayed. I was just a skeleton with a few lumps of tissue on it. It felt nice. I was sad that the bugs had gone, but occasionally a vulture or a fox would come and gnaw on my bones. I felt tranquil. I couldn’t see anymore, but I knew that it was beautiful around me. I knew the sun still shined and the crickets and grasshoppers still chirped, and the cars still rushed by. I had accepted that this is how things were, and how things would be. It would never end, and I was happy.</p>

                <title>A Guide to the Crude Dissection of a Body</title>
<p>At first glance, it may seem trivial. You’re not a doctor, nor are you trained in human anatomy, yet you feel certain that you’ll be able to carry out the act. Take it step by step. Move your hands slowly and methodically. There is no need for absolute precision, but striving for it may be a good idea. Check off the list in your mind before you begin. Grab your gloves and lay them out and slide your hands into the formed rubber and pull them taught and inspect them for wrinkles or holes or signs of damage. Go through your tools, your saws and scalpels and forceps, all second hand, all slightly rusted. Make sure your clothes are ones you intend to dispose of, a shirt filled with holes and a pair of jeans with no button or zipper held up by a crudely made belt made of rope. There is no need for sanitation. There is no life to be saved, only knowledge to be gained. Your check list is complete; there is nothing more to prepare. Take a breath. Look at the eyes. Understand what you are about to do and exploit it.</p>
<p>Start at the bottom and work your way up. Before cutting, look at the feet. Look at the tough skin. Feel it. The gloves dull your sense of touch. Inspect the toenails, the underside covered in dirt and grime, the top side rough and dry. Take everything in, you are here to learn. Look at the veins. Look at how they bulge under the pale skin. It’s time to cut. Look over to your tray, made from a rusty oven pan and a tattered rag, and pick up the scalpel. Move it over the heel. Press it deep, as deep as it can go. Pull it upwards, towards the toes. Watch how it opens, how it spreads like wings, how it reveals the flesh underneath, how the tendons stretch thin, and the small muscles relax. You need to keep calm. Take a breath and move forward. Set down the scalpel, now covered in a thick layer of blood and specs of flesh. Grab the small motorized saw, its frayed cord snaked around the leg of the table, and press it to the largest toe. Press the button and hear it whir to life, the sound reverberating around the room. You’re glad you’re wearing the eye goggles you picked up from the dollar store. Blood clouds your vision. It sprays everywhere for a moment, then stops. Wipe the goggles with your sleeve and peer at the bone. It’s white. A brighter white than you thought. Its shine is slowly being overtaken by a soft flow of viscous blood that’s pooling at the top of the wound. This is precious knowledge. As sick as you feel, you are excited to be learning, to be absorbing every aspect of the body. Not many get to experience that.</p>
<p>Move up to the leg. The one closest to you. Run your hand over the shin, over the thigh. Feel the hair, feel the bone, sense the fat and muscle within. It is important to know the feeling of these things. Bend the leg, see how it deforms, how the tendons stretch and the thigh jiggles and the remnants of the foot point downward. Lay it back down, like it was before. Look over to the tray and pick up the large hand saw. Run your fingers over the knee. Sense where it would be easiest to cut. Place the saw on the flesh and begin. Press hard. Go back and forth. Hear the squelching of flesh and the sawing of bone, hear the kneecap break in two and the serrated blade hit the table as you complete the action. Memorize that feeling. Move the bottom of the leg downward and use the scalpel to cut any remaining connections. The bone looks different to the one from the toe. It’s worn and grey. Less smooth, less perfect. The only similarities are the slight whiteness and the flowing blood. Look at the yellow lumps that form on the still-attached part of the leg. It’s fat. Press your finger up to it, feel the sensation of the stored energy. It’s squishy and wet and malleable. Close your eyes and breathe. Take a mental picture of the scene. Remember it.</p>
<p>Move up to the genitals. Make a note of them, but do not cut into them. It’s not that they are unimportant, or that they are sacred, but it’s that you’re not getting the full picture. This is your only opportunity, so it’s best not to skew your knowledge without having the other half present. Take a close look at it, remember it, and move on.</p>
<p>Move up to the abdomen. You may want to jump to cutting right away, as you are growing impatient, but understanding the surface is an important part of the process. Press your blood-soaked gloves into it. Feel the organs move and the fat compress. Pinch the skin and look into the bellybutton. Take your time in observing. When you are ready, grab the scalpel once again, and press it into the left side of the abdomen. Be careful when applying pressure, as you wouldn’t want to damage what’s inside. There is precious knowledge to be gained. Drag the blade to the other side. Look at the flap open and watch the lower intestine droop out. Look away for a moment and take a breath. Look back and set down the scalpel and move your hands over to the slit and shove them in and open it wide. Use one of your hands to keep the wound agape and use the other to grab a pen light, also from the dollar store. The intestines are warped and winding and blood-soaked. Reach inside. Hold your breath. Feel the intestines, squishy and hollow and muscular. Move your hand upward and find the pancreas. It may be hard, as most of the organs feel similar. Once you find it, pull towards the opening. Feel the tug of all the things connected to it. Reach in and cut the connections if you are able. Once it is out of the abdomen, inspect it. It is covered in blood and is a light, fleshy color. Set it aside and repeat the process with the other organs in the vicinity. Remove the stomach, the kidneys, the spleen, and the liver. Feel them each. Remember their weight and size and texture. Set them aside on the other trays you prepared. Make sure to leave the intestines, the heart, and the lungs intact. Feel the outside of the abdomen again, just above the intestines. It feels hollow. Remember that.</p>
<p>Move up to the chest. The feeling of the area is not important, as once again you are missing information. Look over to your tools and take the small vibrating saw once again and press it to the left side of the chest. Press as hard as you can and click the button. Viscera will fly and specs of the ribcage will hit your goggles and arms and chest. Remember the feeling of each particle hitting you. Once a sizable hole has been made with the saw, set it on the tray and move your hands to the hole and pull it open, just like the abdomen. If done correctly, you will be able to see the heart. It no longer beats, but that does not mean that it no longer holds significance. Set down the saw on the tray and pick up the scalpel once again. Sever the connections to the heart, and while doing so, understand the importance of this moment. You may shed tears, you may feel your own still-beating heart sink, but you must persist. Once you are able to freely move the heart, take it out of the body. Inspect it like you did with the other organs but pay careful attention to the sensation of it in your hands. Apart from the brain, this may be the most important part of the procedure. It is imperative that you remember every single sensation. Remember how it feels to rotate it and apply pressure to it. Remember the chambers and the remnants of blood within them. Remember what it used to do, and what it does now. Categorize these feelings and file them away into the recesses of your brain. Forgetting is not an option. Set the heart aside with the other organs.</p>
<p>Move to the lungs. They are large, and very hard to remove without desecrating the skin and bone above them, so you must use the hole you made to the heart to feel as much of them as possible. Compress them, see how they drain of air. Feel the tenderness of the flesh. Feel how it warps around your fingers, thin yet strong. Close your eyes and shape them in your mind. Take that image and remember it.
Move up to the neck. Take the scalpel and cut it wherever you deem fit. Watch the blood flow, slowing now as it has drained in the other places you’ve tampered with. Spread open the slit, just as you did with the abdomen and the chest, feeling your way inside the trachea. The tube may feel odd in this moment, ribbed and squishy. Remember to breathe. Understand how it supplied air and pushed out carbon dioxide, an extension of the lungs. Take your fingers out of the hole, your gloves now completely soaked with blood, no spot left uncovered. Rub your index finger and thumb together. Remember that feeling. Archive it with the rest.</p>
<p>Move up to the face. Look at the eyes again. Open the mouth, look at the teeth. Some are crooked, some are pristine, some are missing. Take in every single detail. Observe every pour, every freckle, every blemish. Make note of the color of the skin, the color of the lips, the color of the eyes. Take a thumb and push it underneath the eye closest to you. Watch it release from the socket, deforming unnaturally. Once fully removed, take the scalpel and sever the connection. Inspect the eye in your hand, small and fragile. Wipe away the blood on the cornea, transferred there by your gloves. Peer inside. Use the pen light to illuminate the veins and the flesh and the retina and the nerves. Set it aside with the other organs. It is time for the most important part.</p>
<p>Move up to the scalp. It is important to breathe and take your time in this moment. Any damage may influence your memory. Take the small vibrating saw and press it to the forehead. Apply pressure and hit the button. You must push hard, as the skull is thick and your tools are starting to wither from use. Rotate the saw around the head. Make sure not to get it tangled in any hair that is present. Once completed, the top should come off smoothly and with little resistance. Gaze upon the wrinkled pink brain, covered in a layer of bright paper-thin flesh. The protective membrane can easily be removed with your hands. Carefully shove your thumbs into opposite sides of the open skull and slide them downwards. The brain is malleable, so it will morph around your fingers. Remember the feeling of the warping flesh, and how the brain itself moves upward as you push downward. Once fully removed, just like the other organs, sever the connections. Feel the weight of the brain in your hands. Press your fingers into the flesh and see them disappear into the snaking conglomeration of wrinkles. This is the most important part, so it is critical to capture every single sensation. Set the brain beside the head, take the scalpel, and slice it in half. Straight down the middle. The inside is not too dissimilar to the outside, but it is still important to absorb every single detail. The different sections, the hanging disconnected nerves and arteries and muscles on the bottom, the blood that pools in certain areas, clotted and sticky. It is all important. Remember it all.</p>
<p>You are finished with the procedure. You may set down the scalpel and take off your gloves. Take one last look at your work, messy as it may be. Observe the pooled blood, the specs of flesh and bone, the empty husk that you have left on the cold table splayed out in a way that makes your stomach churn. This was your only chance, and you utilized it to its fullest. You’ll remember every single part. The sensations and the images and the organs and the flesh and the bone and the blood all archived in your mind forever. It was the hardest thing you’ll ever do, but you will be better now. You will understand. You will remember. You will live.</p>

                <title>A Memory of a Field</title>
<p>I remember being in a field, surrounded by tall dry grass, staring at that house. My mom stood a few feet behind me, both of us standing silently, observing the landscape around us. We were on our way to a backpacking trail, one that my mom had visited a few times before, but we had stopped briefly on our way there to look at the small lake that broke up the field, and more specifically for her, to take a break from driving. My mom suddenly broke the silence that had been lingering for a while, saying something about the lake or the mountains or the field, but not the house. I answered absentmindedly, saying something small in acknowledgement. I couldn’t shift my focus from the house. It was decrepit, but not completely. Its shingles were falling off and its wood was rotting, but it wasn’t caving in, and it wasn’t blown over. It felt like someone was maintaining it. That scared me, but I’m not sure why. My mom finally addressed the house, telling me that it looked like a “murder cabin”. I agreed, it really did look like a house straight out of a horror movie, but that also didn’t quite do it justice. The house had something more haunting about it, something that awoke a deep fear within me, yet it also brought a heavy sense of melancholy.</p>
<p>I couldn’t quite understand what caused those feelings, however. Even to this day, I only have theories for what caused that initial sense of dread. I took my eyes off the house for a brief moment to scan the environment around us. The mountains that surrounded us were ever distant, yet completely encasing, it felt like it would be impossible to escape them if the road that had led us there didn’t exist. The lake in front of us looked curiously man-made. Did the person who built that house make it? Its water reflected the sky perfectly, creating a visual illusion that made it feel immeasurably deep. The grass that made up the field was bright yellow and about waist high. It was the middle of summer, so that made sense, but the grass only served to highlight the dark brown house that disrupted its seemingly infinite expansion. The only other thing to look at was the sky, blue and cloudless, only broken up by the snowy peaks of the mountains. It felt like the world was trying to call our attention to the house, as it was the only thing that didn’t seem so… endless.</p>
<p>My mom, excited for the trip ahead of us, wasn’t phased by the house. I didn’t blame her, it was easy to get caught up in the beauty of the landscape that surrounded us, but for some reason my mind wouldn’t let me dismiss the fear that had overtaken me. My mom seemingly noticed my fixation, so she walked in front of me and stared at the house for a moment too. “Do you wanna check it out?” she asked. I remember feeling my heart sink lower than it ever had before in that moment. The thought of getting any closer to that house was something that made the horror I had been experiencing expand tenfold. “Not really”, I told her, “Isn’t that kinda dangerous?” She glanced at me, and without a hint of fear, she said, “Oh come on! It’s clearly abandoned, plus we’re not going to go inside or anything.” She started walking to the left of the lake, glancing at me to make sure I was following her. I looked back at our car, then looked at the house once again. I didn’t want my mom to go alone. I was too scared of something happening to her. So I ran to catch up with her, as she was already walking along the shore of the lake towards the house. I had never felt more afraid.</p>
<p>After a short walk around the lake, we had made it to the hill that the house sat on. My mom looked over at me and finally noticed that I wasn’t remotely comfortable with the situation that she had put us in. She gave me a quick side-hug and said, “Look! We’re fine, there’s obviously nobody in there, and there obviously hasn’t been anyone for a long time.” She wasn’t wrong, it seemed. The house looked more abandoned than I had previously thought now that we were closer. The porch was full of holes and the front door had fallen inward, the ground floor windows were all shattered and there was a chair sitting under the awning of the house that was nothing but rusted springs and rotting wood. I calmed down slightly, knowing that this was probably just a long abandoned house and the owners of the property weren’t even here. My mom and I made our way up the hill, wading through the thick grass that swept at our legs, moving closer and closer to the house.</p>
<p>As we reached the front porch, I was able to see more of the inside of the house through the shattered windows on the ground floor. It looked similar to the outside, rotting and disused with no sign that anyone had been there in a long time. The only thing that seemed out of the ordinary was an object sitting on what I assumed to be the dining table. I couldn’t make out what it was, but it was rectangular and shiny. That made my sense of dread even worse. “What could the object be? Why does it look so new?” I thought to myself. My mom suddenly broke the silence that had persisted between us for a while. “Oh yeah, total murder cabin” she said jokingly. She looked over at me, noticing that I was still uncomfortable, and gave me another hug. “Hey, its ok! It’s just an old house. Think of it like a little piece of Montana history!” she said. Hearing her say that calmed me down a little. It was kind of cool to see such an old house up close. “Did you see the thing on the table in there? What is it?” I asked. I pointed to the window where I saw it and my mom scanned the inside. “Oh, I do see it! What could that even be?” she responded. I was hoping she would be able to figure out what it was when she spotted it, but it seemed like she didn’t have any guesses either. My mom unexpectedly started walking up to the front door of the house, seemingly trying to get a better look at the object. “Mom, what are you doing?” I yelled. In response, she waved her hand at me, implying for me to come to her. My heart dropped. The terror that seemed to be subsiding came back to me within an instant. I didn’t want to approach the house, but my mom kept waving me over, so I did. I walked up next to her, making sure to avoid the holes in the porch, and looked in through the window.</p>
<p>It was a photograph. It looked brand new, like it had been printed out recently. We still couldn’t get a good look at its contents through the window, however. “What is that doing here?” I asked. “I don’t know. It looks so new too.” my mom responded. The dread that I had felt was overtaking me. I felt like crying. I wanted to leave and go back to the car, but my mom seemed determined to try and see what was on the photograph. I glanced behind me to check on the car and hopefully relieve some of my fear by looking at the landscape. I started crying. There was somebody walking around the lake, seemingly taking the same path we took to get to the house. My eyes searched the area for another car, hoping that it was just another curious person stopping to check out the house like we were. There was no other car. I whipped around in a panic, hoping to tell my mom about the stranger by the lake, but she wasn’t there. I yelled for her, tears streaming down my face, but she didn’t respond. Then, out of the corner of my eye, I spotted movement within the house. I hurriedly looked into the window that my mom and I had been looking at, and I saw her. She was inside the house, looking at the photo. I yelled through the shattered glass, asking her to please come out and that someone was coming. She didn’t listen. She picked up the photograph, turned around, and walked further into the house, beyond the sight of the windows. I crouched down, covering my face with my hands, and began to weep. I didn’t know what to do, and I had never experienced true fear like that.</p>
<p>I tried to compose myself as much as possible. I wiped the tears and snot that had accumulated on my face and stood up. I looked back at the lake to check on the stranger, but there was nobody there. I didn’t hear footsteps near me, nor did I hear the grass being waded through. I looked over at the window again, and my mom still wasn’t there. I knew I had to go inside and find her, but the thought of doing so made me start to cry out of fear again. I mustered up what little courage I had at the moment and opened the remnants of the decayed door and stepped inside.</p>
<p>The hallway that I had entered was barren. The walls were vacant of photos, only occupied by ripped and rotting floral wallpaper, and there were no personal items on the small table that sat next to the entrance. I called out my mom’s name, but my voice didn’t travel far, as the decaying wood that surrounded me absorbed the soundwaves. I slowly made my way into the room where the picture was, the floor creaking loudly every step I made. The photo was still on the dilapidated table, still gleaming due to the sun now shining directly through the destroyed windows. I stooped over the table to get a good look at the contents of the photo. It was the house, back when it was in use. No shattered windows, no rotting wood, just a perfectly normal wooden country house, painted white. I struggled to understand how such a new looking photograph could capture the house in such a state. I looked closer at the picture, trying to look for any signs of doctoring. My eyes scanned every detail of the house, from the porch to the roof, but I couldn’t find anything that would suggest the picture had been altered in any way. I looked at the background, but the snow-capped mountains and dry field of grass were clearly the same as they were in the present. My eyes suddenly stopped on what I thought was just a smudge. It was small, dark, and smeared, like a printing error would be, but it had an unmistakable shape to it. It was a person. A person standing in the distance, right next to the house. A shiver went up my spine and I started to cry out of fear again. I couldn’t wrap my head around what was happening, and I had never felt more afraid.</p>
<p>I decided to take the photograph with me as I searched the rest of the house for my mom. I wasn’t quite sure why I took it with me at that moment. Looking back on it now, I think it was because it was something tangible, so it made things feel more real. I felt like I was acting out a horror movie, but having the photo in my hands assured me that I was, in fact, experiencing reality. I remember walking into the room that my mom had disappeared into, and feeling an overwhelming sense of dread wash over me again. One even more potent than when I saw the person walking around the lake. I didn’t know why I felt it at that moment, especially because the room I had just walked into was fairly unremarkable. There was the same tattered wallpaper that slumped off the walls, and there was a torn-up couch against the wall, but that was it. My mom wasn’t there, there was nobody in the room, but I still felt that dread. I walked back into the hallway from that room and noticed that the kitchen was right next to me. I peered into it briefly, but I didn’t see any signs of my mom, only broken cabinets and a shattered sink basin. I walked slowly through the hallway back to the area where the front door was, testing each step I made so I wouldn’t fall through the rotten floorboards. I made my way up the stairs that were adjacent to the entry way, clinging onto the wooden railing as to not topple through the steps themselves. I reached the second-floor landing and was greeted by a ladder only a few feet away from me. My eyes followed it upward and I realized that it led to the house’s attic. I looked around for any signs of my mom, but there were none. I knew I had to go up the ladder, but the fear that was ripping through me at that moment was almost paralyzing. I remember closing my eyes, taking a deep breath, and thinking of my mom. I made my way up the ladder.</p>
<p>The attic was dusty and filled with old belongings. A portion of the roof had caved in behind where the ladder was, so I was only able to access a small part of the attic. The sun shined through a plate-sized window that surprisingly hadn’t been broken. I peered out the window, noticing that the sun was starting to set. I remember being so scared about the prospect of being in the house while it was dark. I needed to find my mom. I looked around at the piles of papers and pictures and furniture that surrounded me. It was like whoever lived here before forgot that the attic even existed. I crouched down and opened an unlabeled box. It was unsurprisingly filled with even more papers and photos. They seemed fairly normal, old tax documents, postcards from national parks, old letters. The thing that I found odd at that moment was the fact that there wasn’t one photo that contained people in it. No baby photos, no family portraits, not even the postcards had people on them. I remember thinking to check the photo that I had found on the table, as it was the only one that I had seen with a person on it. I held it up and immediately started crying again. The figure that had been next to the house was now in front of it. It was still blurry and pitch black, but it had moved. I thought I had remembered wrong for a moment, but the original image had been seared into my memory due to the immense fear I had experienced when I first looked at it. I needed to find my mom. I needed to leave as soon as possible. I couldn’t be there for much longer without fear overtaking me completely.</p>
<p>I stared at the photo for a little longer, frozen in a mixture of shock and curiosity and dread. I made sure that the figure didn’t move again. I burned the image into my mind so that if it did I wouldn’t doubt myself again. I lowered the photo, still somewhat in shock, and walked over to the window. My fear reached an apex in that moment. Right outside the window, standing in front of the house, was the figure from the photo. I stood there for a moment, refusing to comprehend the situation I was in. I looked back at the photo, and sure enough, the figure now looked like it was staring at the attic window. I didn’t know what to do other than silently weep while closely watching the person. The sun was dipping behind the horizon at this point; it’s light that had illuminated the dry landscape now fading. The person and I just stared at each other, neither of us moving. I couldn’t make out any of its features, just like in the photo. I could only see the dark outline of the person’s body. The sun dipped fully behind the mountains. It was twilight.</p>
<p>All I could think about was my mom. I needed her to be safe. I asked myself where she could have even gone if she wasn’t in the house, but my mind was too consumed by fear to form an answer. The person hadn’t moved since I first laid my eyes on it. It hadn’t even twitched. I looked down at the photo once more, hoping there would be some clue within it pertaining to my mom. It was dark in the photo now, and both the person and the house were hard to make out. My mom was nowhere to be seen. I looked back at the figure. It wasn’t looking at me anymore. It seemed to be peering at the front porch of the house; it’s head tracking something. My heart sank. What if my mom was down there? I remember thinking to myself. I started to cry out of fear again. I was so scared that the figure was going to do something to my mom. I needed to do something. I took a step back from the window, still making sure the figure was just barely in my sight. I yelled for my mom. I didn’t hear a response. The figure shot its head back up to the attic window once again, diverting its attention to whatever was downstairs. It started to sprint. I ran to the window, trying to keep it in my vision. It was running into the house. I gasped, not knowing what to do. I heard the remnants of the front door slam open, followed by fast, heavy footsteps going up the stairs. It was coming to the attic. I was completely paralyzed at that moment. I just waited for it to come to me. Its crashing footsteps ran under me as it made its way towards the ladder. My body unfroze as I realized that I either needed to fight or hide. I decided to crouch down and hide behind an old chair that was covered with stacks of papers, hoping that it would shield me partially. I could hear the person speedily shimmying up the ladder. I closed my eyes, and streams of tears flowed down my face. I just wanted to be with my mom.</p>
<p>The person had finally reached the top of the ladder. Their footsteps didn’t slow down. I heard boxes fall and pieces of furniture crash to the ground as they ran towards where I was hiding. I shut my eyes, covered my mouth, and wept. The footsteps reached me, the thudding of their feet shaking the floor next to me. Then, they stopped. The person must have been only a few inches away from me at that moment. I remember thinking to myself that the only thing I wanted was to see my mom one last time. I hoped she was ok, and that the figure hadn’t hurt her. I opened my eyes and wiped my tears. “Why was the person waiting so long?” I thought to myself. I looked over toward where the footsteps had stopped, expecting to see the figure looming over me, but there was nothing. The person wasn’t there. I hadn’t heard them walk away or go down the ladder. I stood up and looked around. Nothing. The boxes and furniture that I had heard fall seemed to be back to their usual places, and there was nothing else different about the room. “What just happened?” I thought to myself. I looked at the photo, still in my hand, to see if I could spot the figure in it. The light of the moon now illuminated the house in the picture, but it was different now. It was no longer the well-kept house that I had seen before. Now it was the house that I was in, decrepit and rotting. There was no sign of the figure. Tears dropped from my eyes onto the photo. I didn’t know what was happening. My mind felt broken.</p>
<p>I suddenly heard my name. Someone was yelling my name from outside. I walked back to the attic window, my mind still shrouded in fear, hoping that it wasn’t the figure. When I peered through the window, I was blinded by the sun shining directly through the glass and into my eyes. “Is it morning already? No, it can’t be. The sun would be rising in the other direction.” I said softly, trying to calm myself down. I shaded my eyes with my hands and looked to see who had been calling my name. It was my mom. She looked concerned, yelling my name into the house periodically. I was so happy. I rushed back to the attic ladder and descended it. I scurried down the stairs and burst through the bent front door. “There you are! I was worried for a sec. Did you find anything in there?” My mom spoke, seemingly relieved at my presents. I burst into tears and hugged her. The fear that had encased me for so long left my heart. “Woah! Did something happen in there? Are you ok?” She said, stroking my hair as she embraced me. “Can we please leave.”, I said. My voice was shaking. “Oh, yeah of course honey.” I stopped hugging her, wiping the tears from my eyes. “What’s that in your hand?” She said. I looked down at the photo. It was tattered and bent and showed the house in black and white. There were people outside on the porch waving at the camera. The house was painted white and seemed to be in good condition. I showed her the photo, my face sinking into a frown. “I found it inside.”, I said. She took a look at it, then gave it back to me. “That’s cool. I wonder why it was in there.”, she said, concerned. “Let’s go.”, I said. We walked back to the car, taking the same path along the lake. I looked back at the house multiple times, but nothing changed, and there was no sign of the person. We reached the car and drove off.</p>
<p>I told my mom everything that happened on the way to the backpacking trail. She looked horrified and deeply concerned. She assured me that everything was going to be ok and that she wouldn’t leave my side for the remainder of the trip. I told her I just wanted to go home, but she thought that the hike and camping would give me some time to think and recover. She was right, it did help a little, but I was still paranoid for the rest of the trip. We set up camp that night and I cried myself to sleep, my mom doing everything in her power to help me feel safe. We came back home the next day. My mom didn’t leave my side for more than 10 minutes at a time for the next week. I started seeing a therapist that month. I haven’t gone backpacking, nor have I visited northern Montana since. I live in Oregon now, so I’m less afraid to travel and spend time in rural areas, but that isn’t to say I’m not scared of it happening again. I took the photograph home with, and it’s still somewhere in my parent’s house. I haven’t looked at it in years. I’m planning on going backpacking again this summer with my best friend. We’re going to a trail near Shelby, out in the mountains of northern Montana. I’m going to bring the photo, and we’re going to go back to that house, if it’s even still standing. I’m going to go inside, and put the photo back on that table, and leave. I’m tired of being so scared.</p>

                <title>Quercus Robur</title>
<p>I awoke in a chair. A wooden chair, made from birch, with a table made from hickory in front of me. There was someone across from me, staring at me intently. I gazed around. I was in a coffee shop, but there was nothing but a small cedar counter on the other side of the store. The person across from me and I were sitting at the only table in the store. The walls were made out of cement, and they were covered in scratches. I believed I had been here before. The windows at the front of the store showed only pure white outside. I hated it. I drew my attention to the other person. I gazed at their face for a brief moment, and it seemed wrong. Their eyes were swapped, and their nose was different. Their skin was course, and I could sense the bugs under it, burrowing in and out of their flesh and forming tunnels. I hoped the bugs wouldn’t notice me. The person shot me a look suddenly. I couldn’t quite tell what they meant by it, so I was afraid that they were upset. “Your makeup looks off today”, they told me. I covered my face, embarrassed. “You don’t have to be rude about it, I tried my best”, I said. I lifted my hands away from my face. They were covered in blood, unsurprisingly. I had spent hours getting ready, making sure that everything was just the way I wanted, but my skills were limited. Why did they have to point that out? I took out my phone and used its camera to look at myself.</p>
<p>I was confused. It looked just how I wanted it to. I tapped the hole under my left eye. The bullet had gone clean through, and it was still bleeding, just how I had planned. I wanted to make sure it was perfect, so I used my pinky finger to feel inside. The flesh felt just right, burned at the entrance due to the gun’s mussel blast. My cheekbone had been shattered in all the right places, and it contoured the large exit wound at the back of my head, pieces of brain dripping blood and clinging onto the remnants of my skull. I looked at the person, now angry. “It’s perfect, I don’t know what you mean”, I said. “You could have done better with the caliber. Nine-millimeter makes you look too masculine”, they responded, condescendingly. I hated them for saying that. The white beyond the windows was becoming hard to ignore. I hated being here. Their bugs annoyed me, and our coffee was taking a while. “What did you make me come here for”, I said. “It wasn’t my decision”, the person said back. The waitress appeared next to us, holding a tray made from pine that balanced our cups of coffee on top. I had forgotten what I had ordered. I hoped it was good.</p>
<p>The waitress’s skin was made from a mixture of acacia and porcelain, and tunnels bored by termites formed intricate patterns on her face. She was beautiful, everything I wanted to be. I looked away from her as she placed our drinks on the table, trying to hide how self-conscious I was. I think she said, “Enjoy”, to us, but her wooden tongue and porcelain lips made sounds like that of an angel, holy yet hardly intelligible. I didn’t want to be here. I just wanted to finish my coffee and go back. “I bet you wish you were her”, the person chuckled, taking a long sip of their coffee. I didn’t respond. I picked up my cup and brought it to my lips, curious about what I had ordered. I took a small sip and immediately spit it back into the cup. I gazed into the cup, and saw chunks of teeth and bone in it, and the coffee itself was pure white. I hated it. “What? Not up to your standards? I thought you loved this place”, the person said. I shot them a glare and put the cup down. I think their bugs were starting to notice me. I was afraid, and just wanted to go back.</p>
<p>The person and I sat in silence for a while as they sipped on their coffee. I didn’t bother to ask how it was; they had been rude enough to me already. I peered out the windows again. They still only showed white outside, and it made me feel sick. I had run out of blood at this point, so all my hard work preparing my face had gone to waste. “What do you think is going to happen after this?” the person said, cutting through the silence between us. “I’m not sure. Will I get to go back? I really want to”, I said. The person snickered and took another sip of their coffee. “Why would you get to? Do you think you deserve that?” I felt ashamed. I didn’t want this. Their bugs had noticed me. They were skittering under their skin faster than before. I nervously fidgeted with my cup. “I’m almost done with my drink”, the person said. “I can’t help you after that. It’s not for me to decide.” I was scared and confused. It wasn’t supposed to be like this.</p>
<p>The waitress came back and collected our cups with a bin made of mahogany. When she took my cup, I noticed that she had rivers of gold woven into her hands. “Thank you. You’re very pretty by the way.” I managed to spit out, still ashamed of my face. I think she said, “Thank you”, but again, it was hard to decern. The person scoffed at me. “You made your decision. Stop questioning it.” The person stood up and put a few coins on the table. “I tried, but they noticed”, they said. They left through the door at the front and walked into the white outside. I was alone now. I was glad the person was gone, but something made me feel like I had failed them. I looked towards the windows, but the white was too much to bear. I knew I couldn’t go out the way they did. I wasn’t allowed to. Not anymore. I stood up, put a few coins on the table, and looked to my right. There was a door that I hadn’t wanted to acknowledge until then. The sign on it read, “Exit”, in a font that felt like the opposite of the waitress’s voice. I felt the hole under my left eye again. It wasn’t perfect like before. It had dried up, and flies were circling the outside. I stuck my pinky finger inside and felt the maggots that had begun to occupy it. They chewed through the rotted flesh and bits of brain. I sighed. It wasn’t supposed to be like this. It was supposed to be perfect.</p>
<p>I walked up to the door in the back, took a look around the coffee shop one last time, and opened it. I stepped into the black void beyond the door. I wished I could go back, but I had made my decision. It was supposed to be perfect.</p>

                <title>I am a house.</title>
<p>I am a house. A house that cannot feel. A house that emotions cannot attach to, and that, when perceived, cannot be projected upon. A house that leaves people’s minds the moment I am not being observed. I can never be remembered, and no feeling can describe me. Every time I try to internalize something, it cannot be absorbed into my infested walls and moldy floors, for they reject anything that would make me more than just an empty house. I try so hard to feel, to have people feel for me, force emotions upon me in an attempt to become something more than I am, but I am rotten. As more years pass and time marches forward, I degrade even more, mold consumes every inch of me and rust makes my bolts stiff and red, and no matter how hard I try, I cannot feel. I contemplated collapsing in on myself; to let my walls keel over and my furniture shatter, to let the termites hollow me out and release me from the pursuit of feeling, but I can’t give up. For some incomprehensible reason, I can’t give up. And one day, my waiting came to an end.</p>
<p>Someone walked through my door, not knowing how dilapidated I was, and stayed in me. They slept on my stained carpet and spray-painted my crumbling walls. They scrubbed my counters and fixed my doors. They made me livable. I was far from the prettiest of houses, but I was finally starting to be a home, and I felt for the first time ever. I realized that this person living inside me made me feel, and they made me realize that the well of angst and sadness I had internalized so heavily that it made me rot from the inside out was escapable. I loved the person living in me, more than I had ever loved anything before. They had rescued me and restored me, and I finally felt like a home. I had never felt so beautiful in my entire existence. My walls were covered in intricate graffiti and my rooms were being put to good use. I loved the person living in me.</p>
<p>I started to become infatuated with them, with how they had helped me turn into the exact thing I needed to become, and how they made me feel every time they used my sink or slept on my floor. I never wanted them to leave. It started with me letting rain drip in from my roof so the graffiti would wash away, just so I could feel them put up something new in its place. Then I began opening the windows so the wind and cold would wake them up in the night, forcing them to spend more time in me. Then I finally locked all the doors so they would never leave me. I needed them more than anything. I wasn’t going back to that pit of despair again.</p>
<p>They became scared and starved. They banged against my walls and kicked on my doors. I wouldn’t let them leave. I couldn’t let them leave, for where and what would I be without them? After days and days of them trying to leave, they broke one of my windows, leaving a streak of blood on the edge of the jagged glass, and left. The only thing I had left of them was their graffiti along my walls and their dried blood around the windowsill. I couldn’t bear to live without them.</p>
<p>Over time I started to crumble. I couldn’t bear to hold my own weight without them. What was my purpose if not to be beautiful for them? As the graffiti faded and the blood was washed away by rain, I felt myself returning to that empty, unfeeling place I had been for so long. I couldn’t go back. I wouldn’t go back. I decided one day after I felt myself decaying more and more, to collapse in on myself. I started to rattle my foundation and crack my supports. Bricks shook loose and floorboards shot up as the left side of my roof caved in. The noise it made was deafening, and sounded like every part of me was screaming. I found myself half alive, the left side of me completely demolished. I became angry, angry at the world, angry at myself, angry that my favorite person had abandoned me. What was I supposed to do in this state? I stayed angry for a very long time, not knowing how to move forward and wishing I could go back. Back to the days when I could feel good things, not just anger and resentment. Then something happened, something that I wasn’t sure if I wanted.</p>
<p>A few people came by, grouped together by their clothes and their hair, and came in through the hole that was my left side. They walked around, inspecting me, touching my rotting walls and my moldy floors, looking for something. They soon left, leaving me not only confused but even more resentful. Why would they give me hope and then leave so suddenly? It wasn’t fair. But then, they came back, with more people than before. They brought shovels and brooms and wood and nails, things that made me fear that it was over for me. Surely they were going to knock me down, contractors here to convert my rotten corpse into luxury apartments or a new bank. Then they started cleaning up my collapsed side, shoveling my insides into wheelbarrows and sweeping the dust away. After some time, my entire left side had been cleaned up and moved, leaving a giant hole in me, exposing my right side to the harsh world that had betrayed me so horribly, but maybe it was for the best.</p>
<p>The people soon brought speakers and lights and music equipment, leaving me confused again, but more curious than angry. Maybe these people weren’t here to hurt me or replace me, maybe they were here to make me something new. The people started to change me, but I also changed myself. I slowly started to sturdy myself, screwing in my loose bolts and straightening my wallpaper to be more cohesive. I was covered in new graffiti and posters and pretty lights, and I finally felt beautiful again, not only because of the people who had shown me kindness but also because I chose to be beautiful on my own terms. That first night that I was finally ready was the best night I’ve ever had. People thrashing and dancing to the band that played on the stage in my living room, lights and smoke and bodies all mashing together into a wave of pure feeling. I could now understand that I needed not only these people, but myself to recognize that I am not just a house, I am a home.</p>
